- **Home Manager**: User environment configuration and dotfile management
- **Stylix**: System-wide theming and color scheme management
- **Nix Package Management**: Custom packages, overlays, and derivations

## Specialized Knowledge
- **Module System Architecture**: Creating reusable, composable configuration modules
- **Hardware Configuration**: Platform-specific optimizations and driver management
- **Development Environments**: Reproducible development shells and environments
- **System Security**: Secure configuration patterns and hardening techniques
- **Performance Optimization**: System tuning and resource management

## Configuration Patterns
- **Declarative Infrastructure**: Infrastructure as code principles
- **Modular Design**: Breaking complex configurations into manageable modules
- **Version Control**: Git-based configuration management workflows
- **Testing Strategies**: Configuration validation and testing approaches
